# 🧑‍🎓 Computer Vision - Final Project (CS-GY 6643)

## 🔍 Sign Language Recognition Using I3D and Transformers

This project focuses on **word-level sign language recognition** using deep learning techniques, combining **Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D)** for feature extraction and **Transformers** for temporal modeling. We leverage the **WLASL dataset**, one of the largest publicly available ASL datasets, to train and evaluate our model.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sign languages are complex visual languages used by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Our goal is to develop an **AI-driven system** to **automatically recognize sign language gestures from video data**.

### 🔹 **Motivation**
- Traditional **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** struggle with complex sign language patterns.
- **I3D models** excel at capturing **spatiotemporal** relationships in videos.
- **Transformers** are powerful at modeling **long-range dependencies** in sequential data.
- Our **hybrid approach** combines **I3D and Transformers** to improve sign language recognition accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset: **WLASL**
We use the **Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL) dataset**, which contains:
- 🏷 **2000 ASL words**  
- 🎥 **21,000 videos**  
- 🎭 **100+ signers**  
- 📂 **WLASL subsets:** `WLASL100`, `WLASL300`, `WLASL1000`, `WLASL2000`

## 🏗 Model Architecture

### **🔹 Feature Extraction: I3D Model**
- **Pretrained I3D model** extracts spatiotemporal features from video sequences.
- **3D convolutions** allow it to model motion patterns in signing gestures.
- Output: **1024-dimensional feature vector** per video.

### **🔹 Temporal Modeling: Transformer**
- A **6-layer Transformer encoder** captures sequential dependencies across frames.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention** helps the model focus on important frames.
- **Final classifier** predicts the most likely ASL word from 2000 possible classes.

### **🔹 Alternative Approach: Vision Transformer (ViT)**
- We experimented with **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for feature extraction.
- **Challenges:** Requires **high computational power** and **larger datasets**.
- Results showed **overfitting on smaller subsets** due to dataset limitations.

## 📈 Results & Evaluation

### 🔹 **Evaluation Metrics**
- ✅ **Accuracy (Top-1, Top-5, Top-10)**
- 🎯 **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- 🔍 **Confusion Matrix**
- ⚖ **Balanced Accuracy** (to handle class imbalance)

### 🔹 **Performance Comparison**
| Model | WLASL100 (Top-1) | WLASL300 (Top-1) | WLASL1000 (Top-1) | WLASL2000 (Top-1) |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Baseline I3D** | 65.89% | 56.14% | 47.33% | 32.48% |
| **Proposed I3D + Transformer** | **74.47%** | **57.86%** | **45.13%** | **34.66%** |

✅ **Key Findings**:
- Our **hybrid model outperforms the baseline I3D** on smaller datasets.
- **Class imbalance issues** affect performance on larger datasets (`WLASL2000`).
- **Future improvements**: Weighted sampling, additional fine-tuning.
